## Programming Arduino Nano
The specific Arduino Nano used for this project is an Elegoo brand purchased from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Arduino-ATmega328P-Without-Compatible/dp/B0713XK923). In order to flash the Arduino, you must first install the CH340 driver that can be found online. Afterwards, you must select the 'ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)' from the Processor selection in the Arduino IDE. If done correctly, the program should flash correctly to the board.
